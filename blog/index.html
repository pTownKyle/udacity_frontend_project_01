                    Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just
                    a little while ago. Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a
                    situation where you know you had to act a certain way but
                    when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through
                    with it? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. David,
                    watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before
                    you go, come here.

                <p>
                    I'm Ruffino, a blogger & free thinker. I'm a gamer who loves
                    to try out indie Steam games. I also like to read about
                    anything that interests me. I think it's important to
                    challenge yourself and to question everything you believe.
