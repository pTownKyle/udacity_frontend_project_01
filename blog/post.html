                    <p>
                        <strong> Let's go. You bet. </strong>
                        Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you
                        believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress
                        is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform
                        means more jobs, better education, bigger civic
                        improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast
                        your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red
                        Thomas... Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.
                        I hope so.
                    </p>

                        <em>
                            No, Marty, we've already agreed that having
                            information about the future could be extremely
                            dangerous.
                        </em>
                        Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire
                        drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find
                        out through the natural course of time. Let's go. On the
                        night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Yeah, I'll keep
                        that in mind. Marty, are you alright?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right. I just wanna use the phone. Oh, uh, hey you, get
                        your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta
                        swear?
                        <u> What the hell is this? Well uh, good, fine. </u>

                            I'm Ruffino, a blogger & free thinker. I'm a gamer
                            who loves to try out indie Steam games. I also like
                            to read about anything that interests me. I think
                            it's important to challenge yourself and to question
                            everything you believe.
